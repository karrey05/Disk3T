The data files in this directory contain monthly mean OMI SO2 data that have
been used to generate the monthly SO2 maps on the AVDC website. The monthly
mean OMI SO2 is in DU (Dobson Unit) and has been calculated from daily level 3
OMSO2e data at 0.25x0.25 degree resolution. OMSO2e data can be obtained at
NASA GES DISC website at:
http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/datacollection/OMSO2e_V003.html

Files are named either yyyymm.txt or yyyymm.sav. SAV files are for use with
IDL and have the same data as the .txt files.

Each .txt file contains 1440 column (longitude) and 720 rows (latitude).
Longitude is from  -179.875 to 179.875 with an interval of 0.25 degree.
Latitude is from -89.875 to 89.875 with an interval of 0.25 degree
